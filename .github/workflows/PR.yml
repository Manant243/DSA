            Hello @{{ author }} ðŸ‘‹ 
            Thank you for contributing to the repo. 
            If you have created a new file, please refer to [this discussion]() for naming conventions. 
            A super linter will go through the commited file on your PR. It checks for any compilation or runtime errors. However, it is 
            still in development and is not perfect, so it might fail the lint task. Don't worry in such a case. Wait for 2 days. Within that time 
            I will manually review the changed file and merge if it is okay.
